\chapter{Programming in a reactive way}
\label{chap:problem-statement}

In order to have a good understanding of the true meaning and problem of overproduction, it is important to first define what \textit{reactive programming} is, what its relation to other programming patterns is and how this paradigm is implemented in a library like \textit{Reactive Extensions}, which will be used throughout this thesis.

In order to understand these fundamental principles, this chapter starts off with defining what reactive programming is, as it is described in the literature. Since this paradigm forms the basis of this whole thesis, it is important to establish the exact notion of reactiveness first.

Then the Reactive Extensions API is discussed. It is the context in which overproduction occurs as well as the basis of the tools we will be using to solve this problem. Since this API is not yet considered to be common knowledge and since not much literature is based on it, we will start from the very basics and discuss all the concepts necessary for this thesis.

At the end of this chapter the overproduction problem is introduces, as well as related work that already provides solutions to this problem.
